# Quick Jeopardy!

Built with React + Typescript. Uses the [jService](http://jservice.io/) API to pull 5 random questions in at a time, each display corresponding from a full row of a certain dollar amount from the same episode (for example, it will load 5 $800 questions from an episode aired on YYYY-MM-DD, each question coming from its own row/category).
